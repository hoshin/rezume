# rEZume, because .docx for resumes are a pain in the bum

rEZume is aimed at people that'd rather edit a JSON file than fire up a special text editor they only use to edit their resume in the first place.
It gives a certain level of flexibility, making edit / preview "as simple as" editing a single file and reloading a browser tab
rEZume enables you to pretty much write as much data as possible about you and what you've done so far "once and for all" and then 
decide to use it or not for a resume and in what order, and to avoid deleting or putting aside stuff. Also, this should render the modding of
resumes to fit the job opening in a job hunt a little easier (no more copy-pasting around, or at least as little as possible). 
It also enables "quick fixes" (like rearranging assignments, adding / removing keywords ...) to be actually quick without messing up your whole document.


# How it works

Not much magic happening here, you fill in data, rEZume takes them and fills a template.


## Features

* No special tools needed to edit / display / export to PDF
* You can version your work and keep track of the modifications you did
* You can switch on/off some features : 
    * Display "Relevant assignments" only / display all
    * Display keywords under assignments or not
* You can insert html code into the assignments descriptions. I'd suggest keeping it short though =)
* Makes a nice header section w/ most relevant data (the basics + twitter / github)
* Academic knowledge section lets you pick and mix what you want to show (aka, the "show" property on each academic knowledge entry)
* You can edit all the titles of all the sections and subsections to fit your needs

## Getting started

### Putting data together

### Loading data / configuring rEZume

#### Loading data

#### Configuring Rezume


## Advantages ?

* You can make a self contained resume if you cram everything in the same html file (well if you think you need to), and anyone with a basic browser will be able to display it.
* Provided you do have some kind of browser available, you can print your resume or export it to PDF from your browser.
* It can either be completely self contained or reference other data on the internets (for pictures for example)

## Drawbacks ?

It probably takes some getting used to to edit a JSON file to edit a resume, but it works, I swear =)


# The included template sucks ... anything you wanna do 'bout that?
Unfortunately no, I probably won't. But I'm okay with pull requests =)
